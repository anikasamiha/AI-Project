Ancient dice is a 3d game which is played on a board. The board consists of some cubes. Player stones are travelling from starting point to end point of the board through these cubes. We use two different colors of stone - white and red. There is also a little dice roller box. Here we use four sided dice. Our game is divided into two events- single player and two player. In single player game, the person attempts to play the game is one of the two teams and his opponent is computer which plays in auto-mode. One colored stones from two colors are initialized for the first player and the rest is for the opponent.
 When we flip the dice we get one of the values from 1 to 4.  Stones for each player are moving through one cube to another cube according to the rolling of dice to touch the end point. 
A weight is given to every possible moves. Stones are moving with the highest weighted moves. This will decide whether stones move from its position or not. When two different type of stones are on the same cube the later stone replaces the former one. There will show a message like "no legal moves" when the player has no option for moving his stones. In this way, the player who covers the whole board with all of his stones based on dice rolling will be the winner of game. In two player games, two persons will play the game and the process is alike the single player game.
